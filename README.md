# Vorto_vrp
Solution to a version of the Vehicle Routing Problem(VRP). The problem is to minimize the Cost of deliveries. ​C = 500*NumbDrivers + TotDriverMins. ​ ​For simplicity, euclidean formula measure is used to measure minutes. ​Drivers have a 12 hour shift and must start and end shift at (0,0) depo station.
